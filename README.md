# Unturned Map Merge Tool
Program for merging multiple unturned maps into one. 

## Information
The tool is hard to use and it's not always kept up-to-date with the current version of Unturned.  
We do not provide any documentation or instructions on how to use the tool.  

### We offer to merge maps for you for a small fee.
Join our Discord and create a ticket there. Provide a list of maps you want to merge and info how to arrange them. We charge **$30 USD fee** per merge. 
We only merge the maps using our tool, but we don't finish the maps. In order to make the map playable, you need to finish it yourself or hire someone to do it for you.

## Currently Mergeable Files
Landscape merge works by renaming and copying the files from the original map.  
All of the `.dat` files I'm reading into objects, shifting the positions inside the files, combining and then saving into the output map directory.

**Landscape**  
* Heightmaps/*
* Holes/*
* Splatmaps/*

**Spawns**
* Fauna.dat
* Items.dat
* Jars.dat
* Players.dat
* Vehicles.dat

**Environment**
